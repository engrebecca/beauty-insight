# ðŸ’„ Beauty of Insight ðŸ’„

## Description
Competitive market analysis is often a painstaking process that involves hours of research to build spreadsheets of comprehensive data. Beauty of Insight is a beauty market analysis tool that allows users to simplify and shorten this process by scraping data from competitive websites. 

As a former brand and product manger in the beauty industry, I built this tool to automate much of the process I previously utilized to gather data insights from industry leaders in the prestige beauty market. Users can enter a Sephora product category shop URL and the top products will be saved and displayed. Information such as a product's image, name, brand, MSRP, rating, and reviews are all captured and displayed. The tool also calculates and displays the average MSRP for all products. 

## Features
* React is used to create the application and the user interface components
    * Multiple useState hooks are utilized to access and update the state of URL searches and product information 
    * A useEffect hook initially renders the page with products from database if any exist
* Cherrio is used to parse markup and scrape data from the website
    * Product images, names, brands, MSRPs, ratings, and reviews are scraped using Cherrio
* Mongoose used to query the MongoDB database
    * Route to add multiple products to the database'
    * Route to get all product information form the database to display on page
    * Route to delete individual products from the database and page
    * Route to delete all products to clear database for a new search
    * Route to calculate the average MSRP for all products

## Code
The below code demonstrates how Cherrio is used to scrape product information from markup which is then inserted into the MongoDB.

        app.post("/scrape", async (req, res) => {
            let url = req.body.url;
            let response = await axios.get(url);
            let $ = cheerio.load(response.data);

            $(".css-12egk0t").each(async (i, element) => {
                let product = $(element).find("span[data-at*= 'sku_item_name']").text();
                let brand = $(element).find("span[data-at*= 'sku_item_brand']").text();
                let msrpStr = $(element).find("span[data-at*= 'sku_item_price_list']").text();
                let msrp = parseInt(msrpStr.replace("$", ""));
                let ratingStr = $(element).find("div[class= 'css-jp4jy6']").attr("aria-label");
                let rating = ratingStr.split(" ")[0];
                let reviews = $(element).find("span[class= 'css-1dk1ux']").text();
                let link = `https://sephora.com${$(element).find("a").attr("href")}`;
                let image = `https://sephora.com${$(element).find("img").attr("src")}`;

                // Create new documents in collection to log scraped product info
                if (product, brand, msrp, link, image, ratingStr, reviews) {
                    await db.create({
                        product: product,
                        brand: brand,
                        msrp: msrp,
                        // shadeCount: shadeCount,
                        link: link,
                        image: image,
                        rating: rating,
                        reviews: reviews
                    },
                        function (err, inserted) {
                            if (err) {
                                // Log the error if one is encountered during the query
                                console.log(err);
                            }
                            else {
                                // Otherwise, log the inserted data
                                console.log(inserted);
                            }
                        }
                    );
                };
            });
            // Send a "Scrape Complete" message to the browser
            res.send("Scrape Complete");
        });
